### Hi, I am Do ðŸ‘‹
---
I am a data enthusiast and keen to apply data science to practice. I am also interested to apply BI & Data Analytics to develop the business models with sustainable growth.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on experiments and practices for ETL/ETL workflows with different tech and data stacks/tools.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement E2E Machine Learning (ML) Projects (Data science/ML projects in my to-do list: recommender systems, image processing and computer vision)
- âœ¨ Future area of ML study: possibly Federated Learning (FL) ðŸ¤” - I first learnt of FL and its potential applications in univeristy, FL is quite an interesting area of research, so I might revisit this topic in future ðŸ˜„.
